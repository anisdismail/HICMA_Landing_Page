# HICMA Landing Page


### Temporary notes

For now, hicma.html is the main route to start with, so start by running it please.

Note:
Currently working on goal.html in another folder, am halfway through the page. When done with it, I'll merge it with the main folder.

About Us is done as for styling, unless there is something you need me to change.

Things that I need for the aboutUs: 

1. One member did not specify their info.

**For anything you want me to add, modify or remove, let me know please.**
