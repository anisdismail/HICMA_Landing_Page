# HICMA Landing Page


### Temporary notes

I'll work on routing at the end.

For now, hicma.html is the main route to start with, so start by running it please.

About Us is done as for styling, unless there is something you need me to change.

Regarding the navbar, would you like me to make it fixed (it stays when the user scrolls), or leave it as is?

Things that I need for the aboutUs: 

1. Some info abt the other volunteers if there are any, and any links aka their linkedin or personal website if there are any.


As for the illustrations, i'll let you know tmrw.


**For anything you want me to add, modify or remove, let me know please.**
